<h1 class="title is-1 is-spaced"><i class="fa-solid fa-atom mr-1"></i>Singleton Pattern</h1>
<div class="content">

    <div class="block">
        Singleton pattern is used when code requires only one instance of something at all times.
        In that case, if an instance of an object exists, that instance needs to be returned and worked with.
        If no object of that type has been instanciated yet, then it needs to be instanciated and then returned.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        Implementation recipe:
        <ol>
            <li>Add a private static field to hold the instance of the object</li>
            <li>Make the constructor of the class private</li>
            <li>
                Create a public static method to (create if does not exist and then) return the instance of the object.
            </li>
            <li>Replace all calls in existing code use the method to get the instance of an object</li>
        </ol>

    </div>
    <div class="block">
        The following example illustrates a ticket checker. Imagine you came to see a show, 
        and you give your ticket to any attendants in a booth to verify that your ticket is legitimate
        &mdash; haven't been used yet. And for some reasons there is no database available for use.
        Whoever shows up first and shows a ticket with a certain number, can come in. Anyone else who 
        tries to come in using a ticket that's already been verified cannot come in.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        When a ticket is validated, it's being stored in an internal store (an array of strings), 
        and if there is more than one machine checking the tickets, they need to operate on the same
        subset of data. A singleton is handy in this matter because it maintains one store, and 
        "opening" any other line would not help the matter because they all work with the same 
        data store.
