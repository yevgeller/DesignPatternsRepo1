        I don't have a real-world example for this particular pattern, I have yet to come up with one.
        It's pretty universal and can be applied to many things, yet I don't know what example to use to explain it.

    <div class="block">
        The premise though is that in case a copy of an object is needed, sometimes it's not as easy
        as instantiating an object of the same class and assign properties, the object may have some private fields, or the object is an interface.
        Also, such attempts to instantiate an object require us to know the concrete class, and that is not always flexible.
    </div>

    <div>
        So what's the solution? The solution is offloading the process of copying objects to objects themselves
        by introducing a "clone" method on each of them, and programming it so that the magic is happening inside that method.

    <code class="language-ts">
  interface ICloneable {
    clone();
  }

  class Marble implements ICloneable {
    size: number;
    color: string;
    constructor(size: number, color: string) {
      this.size = size;
      this.color = color;
    }
    clone(): Marble {
      return new Marble(this.size, this.color);
    }
    displayProperties(): string {
      return `size: ${this.size}; color: ${this.color}`;
    }
  }

  let greenMarble = new Marble(1, "green");
  let redMarble = greenMarble.clone();
  redMarble.color = "red";
  console.log(greenMarble.displayProperties());
  console.log(redMarble.displayProperties());

  //output:
  size: 1; color: green
  size: 1; color: red
